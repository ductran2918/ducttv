# About me

## Profession  
I am a data journalist at Tech in Asia. I am based in Saigon, Vietnam. 

My work is about compiling datasets and turn them into stories about tech, founders in Southeast Asia that our readers value and finally pay for. 

I am new to programming. This is my excersice to get used to GitHub.

### Why I am here
With the rapid development of vibe-coding tools, I hope can build something small but useful by myself. Let's see how far I can go. 

### Hobby
I love playing with dogs. My profile picture is my dog. I love her so much.
